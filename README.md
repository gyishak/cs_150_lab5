# Context:
The problem I decided to classify was determining if a patient has diabetes or not. I picked this topic because diabetes is a rising threat in America and was personally interested on more information on this disease.This dataset takes in a number of things like Blood Pressure levels, Insulin levels, etc. and based on those parameters shares if the patient had diabetes or not. 
The parameters I chose to go by is Glucose levels and Age and this is displayed on my dashboard.
